# Predicting Insurance Charges

Pricing in insurance is determined by several factors and is assisted by data analysis. To predict future charges and learn more about supporting pricing decisions, I analyzed insurance customer data. I used Excel to import a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/prediction-of-insurance-charges-using-age-gender) (Kaggle, Bob Wakefield) containing information about demographics and premium charges. With that data, I utilized Excelâ€™s various functions and VBA features to make my analyses and predictions.

The insured represented in the data have an average age around 39, with ages ranging as low as 18 to as high as 64, and the majority of the insured are 18-23 years old. BMI follows a normal distribution and its mean is about 30.6, indicating that most of the insured are overweight or obese. There are almost as many females as there are males represented in the data and about 20% are smokers. In terms of region, the Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest US are almost equally represented.
