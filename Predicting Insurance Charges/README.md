# Predicting Insurance Charges

Pricing in insurance is determined by several factors and is assisted by data analysis. To predict future charges and learn more about supporting pricing decisions, I analyzed insurance customer data. I used Excel to import a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/prediction-of-insurance-charges-using-age-gender) (Kaggle, Bob Wakefield) containing information about demographics and premium charges. With that data, I utilized Excelâ€™s various functions and VBA features to make my analyses and predictions.
