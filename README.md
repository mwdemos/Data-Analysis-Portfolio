Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a mathematics teacher with a growing passion for working with data. Welcome to my data analysis portfolio, where I showcase projects that I have been working on to develop my skills.

## Skills Developed:
- Querying relational databases to assist with analysis
- Crafting visualizations and dashboards to drive and augment communication of insights

## Tools:
- Languages: SQL
- Database management: SQLite / SQLiteStudio
- Visualization: Tableau

## Projects:
| Project Name | Description | Skills Used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MCAS Scores](https://mwdemos.github.io/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/) | Analyzed MCAS data to show how my students' test scores stack up to the rest of the state. Created visualizations using Tableau, wrote SQL queries, and integrated them into a written report to help me and my team reflect on our efficacy and make informed instructional decisions. | importing data, data normalization & standardization, checking data integrity, dashboard design, calculated fields, data filtering, aggregate functions, statistical analysis |
| [Video Game Wishlist](https://github.com/mwdemos/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/Video%20Game%20Wishlist) | Wrote SQL queries to start a database of my own personal video game collection. Mostly for fun and for practice, with some organizational practicality while showing my ability to apply my understanding of SQL. | creating & editing tables, data filtering, aggregate functions, join statements | 
| [Codecademy Projects](https://github.com/mwdemos/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Codecademy%20Projects/README.md) | My solutions to the projects in Codecademy's "Learn SQL" course. They serve as helpful references to myself and show my proficiency with writing queries and solving problems with SQL. | editing databases, creating & manipulating data, writing queries, aggregate functions, working with multiple related tables |
