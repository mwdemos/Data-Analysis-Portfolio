Before this project, I kept a list of games I wanted but didn't own, or owned but didn't finish playing in the notes app on my phone. After some time, the list got long and disorganized. If I'm in the mood for a platformer, I want to be able to reorder my list by genre. If I'm curious how many Mario games I own and haven't finished playing, I want to be able to sort my list by franchise. If I'm trying to justify buying a new console like a PlayStation 5, maybe I want to see how many of my wishlist games are PS5 exclusives. So, the notes app didn't cut it. SQL did, though! Plus, it didn't hurt that I wanted extra practice writing SQL queries anyways. So, I created the table below.

    CREATE TABLE games (
    title TEXT UNIQUE,
    console TEXT,
    release_date YEAR,
    genre TEXT,
    owned TEXT,
    started_playing TEXT,
    franchise TEXT
    );

I actually used the following INSERT query to insert a multitude of games into my table but kept it to one here for the sake of brevity.

    INSERT INTO games
    VALUES ('Demon''s Souls', 'PS5', 2020, 'RPG', 'no', 'no', 'Soulsborne');

    SELECT * FROM games;

    SELECT * FROM games
    WHERE started='yes'
    ORDER BY franchise;

    UPDATE games
    SET console='Game Boy'
    WHERE title LIKE 'Metroid 2%';

    ALTER TABLE games
    RENAME COLUMN started_playing TO started;

    DELETE FROM games
    WHERE title = 'The Outer Worlds';

    CREATE TABLE snes_wishlist (
    title TEXT
    );

    INSERT INTO snes_wishlist
    VALUES ('Megaman X');

    SELECT * FROM snes_wishlist;
