  <h1>MCAS Scores</h1>

    <p>In Spring, my mathematics department discussed our students' recently released MCAS scores (grades 7, 8 and 10). MCAS scores are important to consider due to their implications about student learning. Students are also required to pass MCAS tests in 10th grade in order to graduate from high school. The state of Massachusetts uses MCAS scores as benchmarks not only for student learning but for schools' performance as well. The MCAS test changed in 2017--the old, 2017 and earlier version is now referred to as the "Legacy" test and the newer version is called the "Next Generation" test. I took publicly available data regarding 2017 and 2023 MCAS scores from a .csv file online as well as from my team and the MA Department of Educationâ€™s website for this project.

    </ul>
	
    My goal was to use the data to compare my school, Pioneer Valley Performing Arts, to the rest of the state in terms of mathematics MCAS scores.</p>

    <h2>2023 Scores</h2>

    <p>To get an initial idea of how PVPA students did, I imported the data into Tableau and created some bar graphs with the x- and y-axes as achievement level and percentage of students, respectively. I started with a PVPA-specific y-axis and then made similar graphs with the statewide averages. In Tableau, I had to add table calculations to get percentage outputs from the PVPA raw score inputs, import percentage values directly from the DoE data, and add some dashboard formatting to make the visualizations easier to read.</p>

    <p>Taking a first look at the 2023 data, we can see from the graphs that PVPA has a consistently lower percentage of students who exceeded expectations. For those who met expectations, the percent of 7th and 10th grade students is quite similar between PVPA and the state, considering that the PVPA 7th graders are only about 5 percent fewer than the state average and there are about 4 percent more PVPA 10th graders than statewide at this achievement level. In 8th grade, however, we see a whopping 25 percent fewer PVPA students meeting expectations than the state. Another striking difference between PVPA and the state is the greater percentage of PVPA students across all three grade levels who partially met expectations. At this achievement level, the state has 40 or 42 percent of its students in each grade level while PVPA students make up about 56, 67, and 47 percent in 7th, 8th, and 10th grade respectively.</p>
