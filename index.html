  <h1>MCAS Scores</h1>

    <p>In Spring, my mathematics department had discussions about our students' recently released MCAS scores (grades 7, 8 and 10). MCAS scores are important to consider due to their implications about student learning. Students are also required to pass MCAS tests in 10th grade in order to graduate from high school. The state of Massachusetts uses MCAS scores not only as benchmarks for student learning but as benchmarks for schools' performance. The MCAS test changed in 2017--the old, 2017 and earlier version is now referred to as the "Legacy" test and the newer version is called the "Next Generation" test. I took publicly available data regarding 2017 and 2023 MCAS scores from a .csv file as well as data from the MA Department of Education for this project.

    </ul>
	
    My goal was to use the data to compare my school, Pioneer Valley Performing Arts, to the rest of the state in terms of mathematics MCAS scores.</p>

    <p>Taking a first look at the 2023 data, we can see from the graphs that PVPA has a consistently lower percentage of students who exceeded expectations. For those who met expectations, the percent of 7th and 10th grade students is quite similar between PVPA and the state, considering that the PVPA 7th graders are only about 5 percent fewer than the state average and there are about 4 percent more PVPA 10th graders than statewide at this achievement level. In 8th grade, however, we see a whopping 25 percent fewer PVPA students meeting expectations than the state. Another striking difference between PVPA and the state is the greater percentage of PVPA students across all three grade levels who partially met expectations. At this achievement level, the state has 40 or 42 percent of its students in each grade level while PVPA students make up about 56, 67, and 47 percent in 7th, 8th, and 10th grade respectively.</p>
