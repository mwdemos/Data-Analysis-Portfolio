  <h1>MCAS Scores</h1>

    <p>In Spring, my mathematics department had discussions about recently released MCAS scores of our students (grades 7, 8 and 10). MCAS scores are important to consider due to their implications about student learning. Students are also required to pass MCAS tests in 10th grade in order to graduate from high school. The state of Massachusetts uses MCAS scores as benchmarks for learning. The MCAS test changed in 2017--the old, 2017 and earlier version is now referred to as the "Legacy" test and the newer version is called the "Next Generation" test. I took publicly available data regarding 2017 and 2023 MCAS scores from a .csv file as well as data from the MA Department of Education for this project.

      <li><a href="https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/staterc/?fyCode=2023">MA DoE data</a></li>
    </ul>
	
    My goal was to compare my school to the rest of the state in terms of mathematics MCAS scores.</p>
