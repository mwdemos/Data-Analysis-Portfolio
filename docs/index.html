  <h1 style="font-family: Calibri;">MCAS Scores</h1>
    <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri; font-size:100%;">In Spring, my mathematics department discussed our students' recently released MCAS scores (grades 7, 8 and 10). MCAS scores are important to consider due to their implications about student learning. Students are also required to pass MCAS tests in tenth grade in order to graduate from high school. The state of Massachusetts uses MCAS scores as benchmarks not only for student learning but for schools' performance as well. The MCAS test changed in 2017--the old, 2017 and earlier version is now referred to as the "Legacy" test and the newer version is called the "Next Generation" test. I took publicly available data regarding 2017 and 2023 MCAS scores from a .csv file online as well as from my team and the MA Department of Education’s website for this project.

    <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">My goal was to use the data to compare my school, Pioneer Valley Performing Arts, to the rest of the state in terms of mathematics MCAS scores.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family: Calibri;">2023 Scores</h1>
      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">To get an idea of how PVPA students did, I imported the data into Tableau and created some bar graphs where the x- and y-axes are "achievement level" and "percentage of students," respectively. I started with a PVPA-specific y-axis and then made similar graphs with the statewide averages. In Tableau, I had to add table calculations to get percentage outputs from the PVPA raw score inputs, import percentage values directly from the DoE data, and add some dashboard formatting to make the visualizations easier to read.</p>

      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">In the 2023 visualizations, we can see from the graphs that PVPA has a consistently lower percentage of students who exceeded expectations. For those who met expectations, the percentages of seventh and tenth grade students are quite similar between PVPA and the state, considering that the PVPA seventh graders are only about five percent fewer than the state average and there are about four percent more PVPA tenth graders than statewide at this achievement level. In eighth grade, however, we see a whopping twenty-five percent fewer PVPA students meeting expectations than the state. Another striking difference between PVPA and the state is the greater percentage of PVPA students across all three grade levels who only partially met expectations. At this achievement level, the state has forty or forty-two percent of its students in each grade level while PVPA students make up about fifty-six, sixty-seven, and forty-seven percent in seventh, eighth, and tenth grade respectively. All six of the 2023 graphs appear to be skewed left with both PVPA and state tenth grade much closer to a normal distribution than the other grades, suggesting that generally more seventh and eighth grade students scored on the lower end. Tenth graders’ scores are centered symmetrically around the middle, falling mostly in "meeting expectations" or "partially meeting expectations" and generally not achieving exceptionally high or low.</p>
	
    <h1 style="font-family: Calibri;">2017 Scores</h1>
      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">With the 2017 data, I set out to match my 2023 visualizations and make similar interpretations. Here, I had to set up calculated fields in Tableau to compute the percentages of students at each achievement level. I coded in some basic averages e.g.</p> 

        <div style="padding-left: 1vw; font-family: monospace, monospace;"> <p><span style="color: #333FFF;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #FF7400;">[MCAS 10thGrade Math A #]</span>)/(<span style="color: #333FFF;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #FF7400;">[MCAS 10thGrade Math A #]</span>)+<span style="color: #333FFF;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #FF7400;">[MCAS 10thGrade Math NI #]</span>)+<span style="color: #333FFF;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #FF7400;">[MCAS 10thGrade Math P #]</span>)+<span style="color: #333FFF;">SUM</span>(<span style="color: #FF7400;">[MCAS 10thGrade Math W/F #]</span>))</p></div>
	
      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">and used “format number” to make Tableau output the results as percentages before formatting the graphs into concise dashboards.</p>
     
      <img src="images/2017_vs.png" alt="2017 PVPA vs. State" style="margin-left: 1vw;">

      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">This data appears to be confounding. When comparing PVPA and the state, the 2023 data follows a loosely similar shape and here it does not. First, we can see in the PVPA data that seventh and eighth grade have a similar, more centered shape that is much different from that of tenth grade which is skewed right. The tenth grade scores tend to include significantly more on the higher end, most likely due to the fact that passing is a requirement for graduation. This trend can be seen in the 2023 data too. Crucially, another factor at play here is the difference in the tests themselves. Since the Next Generation MCAS test made its debut in 2017 only in grades 3-8, we should expect to see a difference in performance between middle school and high school scores, such as fewer scores on the high end resulting in a skew left, like we saw clearly in the 2023 statewide data. Except the statewide 2017 middle school data doesn’t follow that pattern. Instead, the middle school graphs have the same shape as the high school graph, with quite a few more percentage points in the higher achievement levels than we should anticipate. Furthermore, the PVPA and state tenth grade graphs are quite similar.</p>

      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">So, the middle school data raises some red flags. I took a closer look at the 2017 data to find out why. I noticed that the middle school data is recorded in Legacy scores (advanced, proficient, needs improvement, and warning/failing), but every middle schooler across the state took the Next Generation test that year. I went straight to the source and dug through the MA DoE website and found some 2017 test score data. The percentages didn’t match up to the state data for seventh and eighth grade, but they did for tenth grade. So, the 2017 middle school values in the data source I used are flawed. Though, the incorrect values are in fact similar to the state data’s Legacy test scores for previous years. Perhaps the compiler of this data source took averages from previous years and inserted that into 2017 instead of using next gen scores. This might have been done in order to keep some standardization amongst the data, but I can only guess.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family: Calibri;">Comparing "Advanced" Scores at a Local Level</h1>

      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">One of the things we spoke about in our department meetings was the amount of students that scored at the highest level. PVPA students had fewer of these scores than the state, which was especially true for middle school. It was also true in 2017, except for tenth grade. Here, PVPA had a slightly higher percentage than the state average.</p>

      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">I wondered where PVPA lands more locally. I used the 2017 data available to me to compare PVPA on three levels: town (South Hadley), county (Hampshire), and region (Pioneer Valley). I created graphs with x representing schools and y representing percent of students. Filtering the “town” measure created a list of checkboxes that allowed me to show the percentages for whichever towns I needed for each of the three local levels. Before making my inferences, I made the graphs more presentable and easy to read with formatting such as excluding null values, sorting, highlighting, normalizing axis scaling, and removing clutter from headers, captions, and titles.</p>
	
      <img src="images/2017_Advanced.png" alt="2017 Local A Percentages" style="margin-left: 1vw;">

      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">For the percentage of students who received the highest score, “advanced,” the graphs show PVPA as being on par with South Hadley. It was in the top five out of fourteen schools in Hampshire County, and it had the seventh highest percentage out of thirty-eight schools in the Pioneer Valley. In each level, the difference in percentage between the top school and PVPA was only seven percent.</p>

      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">I also calculated the Hampshire County average and Pioneer Valley average by using SQL queries like the one below.</p>

        <div style="padding-left: 1vw; font-family: monospace;">
	  <p><span style="color: #FFFFFF; background-color:black;">SELECT <span style="color: #AAAAAA; background-color:black;">AVG("% MCAS_10thGrade_Math_A") </span><span style="color: #FFFFFF; background-color:black;">AS </span><span style="color: #AAAAAA; background-color:black;">average_advanced_10th_hcounty</span>
	  <br>FROM <span style="color: #138AE7; background-color:black;">publicschools</span>
	  <br>WHERE <span style="color: #AAAAAA; background-color:black;">"School Name" </span><span style="color: #FFFFFF; background-color:black;">IN </span><span style="color: #AAAAAA; background-color:black;">(<span style="color: #1CEC1C; background-color:black;"><i>'Amherst Regional High'</i></span>, <span style="color: #1CEC1C; background-color:black;"><i>'Belchertown High'</i></span>, <span style="color: #1CEC1C; background-color:black;"><i>...</i></span>);</span></span>
	  </p>
	</div>

      <img src="images/AAvgHampshireCounty.png" alt="Hampshire County Average" style="margin-left: 1vw;"> <img src="images/AAvgPioneerValley.png" alt="Pioneer Valley Average" style="margin-left: 1vw;">

      <p style="line-height:1.5; font-family: Calibri;">The outputs show PVPA as having about seven percent more students at the highest level than the Hampshire County average and about twenty-one percent more than the Pioneer Valley average. PVPA might have had a comparatively lower percentage at the highest score in 2023, but certainly not in 2017.</p>
